# Dataset Preparation

We provide our labels in the `labels` directory.

## HMDB51

1. We downloaded the offical version of HMDB51 dataset from the [dataset provider](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/#Downloads) and videos are placed in the data directory.

2. Once the dataset has been fully downloaded, generate the CSV files for training and validation using `csv_writer.py`, as `train.csv` and `val.csv`. The required format for the CSV files is as follows:

```
<path_1>,<label_1>
<path_2>,<label_2>
...
<path_n>,<label_n>
```
where `<path_i>` points to a video file, and `<label_i>` is an integer between `0` and `num_classes - 1`.

|       Dataset      | Number of Classes |  Total Number of Videos   | Train | Validation | Average Video Duration | Resoultion |
|:----------------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| HMDB51 |    51   | 6766 | 5441 |  1335  | 1 ~ 10 sec | 320 Ã— 240 |
